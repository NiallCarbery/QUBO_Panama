# Length Data
- Syntethic Data of Length Ranges based on the market segment 
- Range of Available Lengths were created with these considerations
Container Ships: Sizes have increased over time to improve economies of scale. NeoPanamax container ships often reach lengths close to the maximum allowed by the expanded canal.

Tanker and Bulk Carriers: Their sizes are optimized based on cargo density and trade routes. Panamax tankers and bulk carriers are commonly around 225 to 250 meters in length.

Specialized Vessels: Ships like LNG and LPG carriers have unique design considerations due to their cargo's nature, affecting their dimensions.



## Proccessing
